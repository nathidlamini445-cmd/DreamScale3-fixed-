      overview: "Surrealism emerged in the early 1920s as a cultural and artistic movement that sought to free the human mind from the constraints of rational thought and societal norms. The movement formally began in 1924, when André Breton, often called the 'Pope of Surrealism,' published The Surrealist Manifesto. Surrealism was rooted in the ideas of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, particularly his theories on dreams, repression, and the unconscious mind. Artists and writers believed that true creativity came not from reason, but from tapping into the irrational, dreamlike, and subconscious aspects of human thought.",
